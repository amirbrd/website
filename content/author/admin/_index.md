I am a post doctoral researcher at the [Intelligent Transportation Systems lab at MIT](https://www.its.mit.edu) and at [The Hebrew University Business School](https://bschool-en.huji.ac.il//). I completed my doctorate (2022) in the field of [Operations Research](https://bschool-en.huji.ac.il/academic-units) under Prof. [Nicole Adler](https://nicoleadler.huji.ac.il/). My research focuses on optimizing transportation policy using game theory modeling tools and big data analyses to validate the models. I'm also preparing policy papers on transportation issues in Israel, mostly [parking](project/14-steps-for-better-parking-management/) and [biking](project/bicycle-shared-infrastructure/), and presenting them in various forums.
