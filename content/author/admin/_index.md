I am an [Operations Research](http://bschool-8-21.huji.ac.il/en/Faculty_%26amp%3B_Research/Academic_Departments#or) [PhD candidate](http://bschool-8-21.huji.ac.il/en//Faculty_%26amp%3B_Research/Research_Students/Amir_Brudner) at [The School of Business Administration](http://bschool-8-21.huji.ac.il//en) in [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/en/), advised by Prof. [Nicole Adler](https://nicoleadler.huji.ac.il/). My research focuses on optimizing transportation policy using game theory modeling tools and big data analyses to validate the models. I'm also preparing policy papers on transportation issues in Israel and presenting them in various forums. Most transportation issues I'm dealing with are [parking policies](project/14-steps-for-better-parking-management/) and [biking](project/bicycle-shared-infrastructure/).
