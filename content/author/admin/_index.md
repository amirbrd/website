Welcome to my website. I am an [Operations Research](http://bschool.huji.ac.il/en/Faculty_%26amp%3B_Research/Academic_Departments#or) doctoral student at [The School of Business Administration](http://bschool.huji.ac.il/en) in [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://new.huji.ac.il/en). My research is focusing on the optimization of transportation policy using game theory modeling tools and big data analyses to validate the models. In my spare time, I'm also preparing policy papers on transportation issues in Jerusalem, my home town, and presenting them in various forums. Most transportation issues I'm dealing with in Jerusalem are [biking](project/bicycle-shared-infrastructure/) and parking policy.
