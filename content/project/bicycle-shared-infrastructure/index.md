### Background
Much of the urban traffic infrastructure is actually made of local streets with low volumes and with relatively low speeds. In those streets, usually, there is no need for segregated bicycle infrastructure and cycling can be incorporated into the general traffic.

### implementation
In order to secure cycling safety, usually 3 steps should be taken:

1. Slow down the car traffic to maximum 30 km/h - this should be also with signs and enforcement and with physical measures like narrowing the street, speed bumps (less recommended) and other traffic calming measures. The lower speed should increase the safty of pedestrians and cyclist alike (Kim, et al., 2007)

2. Give cyclists the Legitimacy - this can be done with signs such as "Cyclist may use full lane" and on-road sharrow-like markings in the middle of the street.

3. Contraflow cycling - make it possible for cyclists to ride both ways in one-way streets. This has been proven as a safe measure and by itself functions as a traffic calming measure. This method is currently the default measure for one-way streets in France and Belgium.
